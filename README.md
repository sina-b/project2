## How to play:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the matching card with the identical symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped back again.
* The game ends as soon as one matching pair is found.
